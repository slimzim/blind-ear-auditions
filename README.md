## Summary 
 > Blind Ear Auditions is an application designed to help symphony orchestras streamline the audition process.  Judges upload their scores and comments to a database through an elegant UI, and audition candidates retrieve their comments after the audition.   I was a symphony musician for 13 years, and I always dreamed an application like this - it's been fun to get the idea off the ground!

## Challenges

 1. <b>Handlebars:</b> One of the requirements for this project was to use the Handlebars templating engine, which we found limiting.. 

 2. <b>Time Constraint:</b> With only a couple of weeks to create the application, what we came up with barely scratches the surface of this application's potential.

## Future Development 

 1. <b>React:</b> Now that we've learned React and Bootcamp is over, my teammates and I are working on rebuilding the application using React instead of Handlebars.  
 
 2. <b>Firebase:</b> One of our team members has acquired tremendous skill with Firebase, and we plan to use Firebase for authentication and a messaging feature that will be well suited to the needs of this application.
 
 3. <b>Mobile Friendliness:</b> A real-world usage of this application will require a mobile version, and we plan to place more focus on mobile in this next round of development.
